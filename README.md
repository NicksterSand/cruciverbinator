# cruciverbinator
A tool for cruciverbalists* to brute force sections of their puzzles while still offering some control.
## How does it work?
Give it a section of a grid along with wordlists for each entry, and it will chug through all of the possible combinations to see if you can use those words to fill that section.

I made this because I realized that the method I was using to fill corners manually was pretty much just brute force with preferences for a few words, so I made this tool to allow myself to enumerate those preferences to my computer and stop stressing about letters and boxes so much.



\*A cruciverbalist is a person who make crossword puzzles
